<p align="center"> "Starting her career as the only woman in a sea of men, [Stephanie Buscemi] believed that she needed to “dress like a man and act like a man” in order to be successful.

Many well-meaning female leadership development programmes share this belief, teaching women to negotiate, network and make decisions “like a man”. The unintended message this communicates is that there is something wrong with how women lead.

That approach often backfires. “I thought I had to emulate the men around me. I was miserable,” says Buscemi. Over time, she learned that her desire to empathise and build relationships with those around her was a strength, and worked to adapt her leadership style without losing herself in the process. “It took me a while, but I began to find a balance between sharing a bit more of my personality and learning how not to open the kimono too far!”" <a><https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2016/jan/25/how-to-lead-like-a-woman-in-a-mans-world></a></p>
